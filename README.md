# SharpApp

# In this project we can see 2 classes one is OutPut and one is Person

# OutPut class has no constructors - so all its logic is handeled inside its' body

# Person class has several constuctors, but hte only one we need to pay attention  to is the one at the top of the body class.

# So when initializing an instance of this class we need to give its' constuctor additional information, like a function needing an arguemnt.

# In our case it's the name of a person or whatever word you like.
